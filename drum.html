<p>A magnetic drum is a magnetic storage device used in many early computers as the main working memory, similar to how modern computers use random access memory (RAM) cards. In some cases, magnetic drum memory was also used for secondary storage. It is basically a metal cylinder that is coated with a magnetic iron-oxide material where the changing magnetic polarities are used to store data on its surface, similar to how modern disk drives use magnetism to store and retrieve data. </p>
