<P>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS),<br>
 application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's pr
 ocessor. RAM is the main memory in a computer.

 <h2><u><i> DRAM(DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY)</H2>
     <P>Dynamic random-access memory (dynamic RAM or DRAM) is a type of random-access semiconductor memory<br>
	 that stores each bit of data in a memory cell, usually consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor.

 <H2><u><i>SRAM(STATIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY)</H2>
     <p>t is the abbreviation of static random-access memory, which is a type of semiconductor random-access<br>
	 memory. It stores each bit by adopting bistable latching circuitry (flip-flop).
