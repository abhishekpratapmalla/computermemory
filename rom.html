   <p>ROM is a primary memory that stores information permanently .
   It is called read only memory because we can only read the programs
   and stored into it but cannot write on it . ROM stores a program 
   containing instructions called 'firmware' that helps to start up
   a computer which is known as bootstrap. however, there are some types
   of ROM.</p>
