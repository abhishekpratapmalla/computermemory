<h1 style=background-color:mediumseagreen; > EPROM(ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY)</h1>
<p>EPROM can be erased many times and reprogrammed as we like . ultraviolet light is passed in a
specific frequency with a quartz window for around 40 minutes to erase the data . when it is 
to ultraviolet light,it wont retain the content , it is totally blank.</p>
