	 <p align="center">cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory
	    in the modeorn days, it is located or integred directly 
		with the CPU chip. it is faster than the main memory that 
		RAM. the CPU can access it more quickly than the main 
		memory because it is directly integrad with cpu and looks 
		the cache first to get data and instructions.it also play 
		the role of buffer between the CPU and main memory.
		cache memory holds the data and programs which are most
		frequently used by the cpu . so it makes sure that the 
		data is instantly availablel for cpu whenever the cpu
		needs . in the other word, if the cpu finds the data or 
		instructions in the cache memory it doesnt need to access 
		the primary memory that is random access memory.</p>
